## Overview

Can a free Burton–Miller + FMM solver (Mesh2HRTF / NumCalc) replace a
closed BEM code for array design on a dummy + headset in the
$100 \mathrm{Hz}$ – $8 \mathrm{kHz}$ AR/VR band?

This repo publishes the meshes, the transfer functions, and example
MVDR patterns. The optimiser is not included. White-noise gain is
floored at $-25 \mathrm{dB}$ below $500 \mathrm{Hz}$, then ramps to
$-30 \mathrm{dB}$ above $1 \mathrm{kHz}$.

**Part II** (this page, first) — KEMAR-style dummy + generic VR headset,
four reciprocal point sources on a $2.5 \mathrm{cm}$ line, far-field
TFs toward $\mathbf{r}=(1,0,0) \mathrm{m}$, boundary $|p|$, planar
beampattern, DI and WNG.

**Part I** — rigid sphere $a=0.10 \mathrm{m}$, Ico-4 versus Morse,
point source $2 \mathrm{mm}$ off the skin, observers at $10 \mathrm{m}$.
That run fixes units, standoff, and trust in NumCalc.

**Part III** (later) — near-field beamforming, three vertical microphones.

### 1. KEMAR + VR headset: the CAD file

High-resolution geometry of a KEMAR-style head integrated with a **generic** VR headset.  
Used as the domain for **open-source BEM** (Mesh2HRTF / NumCalc) to compute microphone transfer functions.
This is an in-house concept mesh for open BEM (Mesh2HRTF / NumCalc).
It is **not** a vendor product and is **not** affiliated with any commercial
VR headset.

#### Head and torso

KEMAR-style dummy CAD developed at **ICAR**
(*Infrastructure commune en acoustique pour la recherche*,
ÉTS–IRSST, École de technologie supérieure, Montréal).

#### Headset

A high-quality generic VR-headset CAD by **Chris Leung** on GrabCAD:
https://grabcad.com/chris.leung-5/models

The headset was simplified and edited: the headband was extended around the head, and reduced to about
$5–6 \mathrm{cm}$ width. The edited headset was then merged with the
KEMAR-style dummy into a single watertight skin.

The working file distributed here is an **STL** surface mesh (plus the
Mesh2HRTF `ObjectMeshes` export).

#### Coordinates and units

Units are **metres**.

- Origin: midway between the two ear-canal / pinna references.
- $+x$: look-ahead (nose / headset front).
- $+y$: left–right axis through the two ears (sign: state whether $+y$ is
  **left** or **right** when you check in Blender).
- $+z$: up.

The skin is **not** a topological sphere. A gap between the headset strap and the head, just forward of each pinna, makes two handles (homeomorphic to a sphere with two handles, genus 2). BEM treats the surface as a rigid sound-hard boundary; the strap–head tunnels are part of the exterior domain. 

#### What the mesh is for

- beamforming (MVDR / LCMV)
- sound-source localisation
- binaural beamforming
- Ambisonics / array processing on a dummy + headset

Microphone examples in this repo use a small linear subset on one side of the headset (2.5 cm spacing). Reciprocal point sources sit $2 \mathrm{mm}$ off the skin.

This repository documents **validation** and **far-field TFs** for a 4-microphone subset of the array. Beamforming examples (MVDR, near-field) can be built from these TFs; **the optimizer is not published**.

Company page: [bloo-audio.com/array51](https://www.bloo-audio.com/array51/)

### 2. Linear microphone array — look direction $(1,0,0) m$

Four reciprocal point sources sit $2 \mathrm{mm}$ off the skin on the right side of the headset, $2.5 \mathrm{cm}$ apart, on a linear end-fire line. Each NumCalc run is the transfer function $H_m(f;\mathbf{r})$ between seat $m=1,2,3,4$ and the field. 
The design look is the $1 \mathrm{m}$ station $\mathbf{r}=(1,0,0)\,\mathrm{m}$ ($+x$, nose). The beam is **fixed frontal**: one steering vector toward that point.
The rest of the $\sim 1850$-point unit sphere is only used to plot the pattern and to build the isotropic covariance.

Against a reference FEM/BEM run, magnitude stays within about $0.2 \mathrm{dB}$; phase matches after the $e^{\pm j\omega t}$
convention (`-angle` on NumCalc). MVDR uses these TFs with a WNG floor of $-25 \mathrm{dB}$ below $500 \mathrm{Hz}$, ramping to $-30 \mathrm{dB}$
above $1 \mathrm{kHz}$

### 3. Transfer functions at $(1,0,0)$

The four curves are
$20\log_{10}\bigl|4\pi p (f;\mathbf{r}_{\mathrm{look}})\bigr|$
for $m=1,2,3,4$, look $\mathbf{r}=(1,0,0) \mathrm{m}$.
Seats and standoff are those of §2.

|:---:|
| <p align="center"> <i> Transfer Functions - mic1,2,3,4 to point (1,0,0) m on the Unit Sphere </i> </p>   |

</div>

Below $400 \mathrm{Hz}$, mic\_1 and mic\_2 sit about $0.2 \mathrm{dB}$
off a reference FEM/BEM run — the same low $ka$ bias as on the rigid sphere in Part I.
That mismatch is enough to wrinkle a superdirective MVDR. The WNG floor
in the next section, is there so the weights follow the physics, not the solver noise.

---

### 4. Computation of MVDR beamforming weights — DI and WNG

The four TFs at $\mathbf{r}_{\mathrm{look}}=(1,0,0)\,\mathrm{m}$ form the
steering vector $\mathbf{d}(f)$. The noise field is taken **isotropic**:
the covariance $\Gamma(f)$ is the Gram matrix of the TFs on the $1 \mathrm{m}$
evaluation sphere. Standard MVDR ($\mathbf{w}^H\mathbf{d}=1$) is then
diagonally loaded until the white-noise gain stays above $-25 \mathrm{dB}$.

That floor is a robustness knob, not a performance target. It keeps
$w_{\mathrm{opt}}(f)$ smooth below $500 \mathrm{Hz}$, where Mesh2HRTF
is about $0.2 \mathrm{dB}$ off a reference solver, and it stops the
beam from fitting solver noise. Directivity index (DI) and the
*realised* WNG are plotted against frequency for the same weights.

Note: For an $N$-element array in an ideal **free-field** environment, the theoretical maximum directivity index approaches $10 \log_{10}(N^2) \approx 12 dB$, while the maximum white-noise gain scales as $10 \log_{10}(N) \approx 6 dB$ (see, e.g., Gary W. Elko's foundational chapters on microphone array spatial filtering in Digital Signal Processing Handbook).


The linear algebra is in the Appendix. The optimiser itself is not
published; the TFs and the example patterns are.

### 5. 3D Directivity Patterns

The following 3D polar plots illustrate the spatial directivity and directional gain of the 4-microphone MVDR beamformer at representative frequencies (200 Hz, 1 kHz, and 4 kHz).

These spatial snapshots provide a direct visual counterpart to the frequency-dependent Directivity Index (DI) and White Noise Gain (WNG) curves shown above, highlighting how spatial selectivity and lobe shaping evolve across the spectrum—from the broad low-frequency response to tighter directional control at higher frequencies.

### 6. Directivity v. Frequency (Hz) - Horizontal Plane z=0 

The directivity pattern in the $z=0$ plane clearly reveals the onset of spatial aliasing starting around $6.5\text{–}7\text{ kHz}$. This behavior is directly governed by the inter-element microphone spacing of $d = 2.5\text{ cm}$. Following the fundamental spatial Nyquist criterion in a free-field environment ($f_c = c / 2d$, where $c \approx 346\text{ m/s}$), the critical aliasing frequency evaluates to approximately $6.9\text{ kHz}$. Beyond this threshold, the spatial sampling interval exceeds $\lambda/2$, leading to the emergence of unwanted grating lobes and a loss of directional integrity in the horizontal plane.

### 7. Reproducing the BEM run

Project files (`NC.inp`, skin, $1 \mathrm{m}$ grid) live in `KemarVR_bem/`. <br>

At a fixed frequency the BEM unknown is the boundary field.
NumCalc assembles a square *self-influence* matrix $A(k)$ from the Helmholtz kernel on this skin (KEMAR + headset). $A$ depends on geometry and on frequency $k=\omega/c$ only --- not on where the point source sits. The source position appears in the right-hand side $b(k)$.
Four seats should therefore be four $b$'s and **one** factorisation
of $A(k)$. Today each `source_*` folder still rebuilds $A$.
$A$ cannot be reused from one frequency to the next.

Parameters: 
$c=346.18 \mathrm{m/s}$, FMM cluster $0.05 \mathrm{m}$,
standoff $2 \mathrm{mm}$: see `NC.inp`.


NumCalc is a Unix binary. On Windows, install **WSL2** with Ubuntu
22.04 and open that terminal (not PowerShell). <br>
In the Ubuntu window:

```bash
cd KemarVR_bem/NumCalc
./NumCalc
```

## Part I — Validation of the Mesh2HRTF BEM Solver <br> (Rigid Sphere, $a = 0.1 \mathrm{m}$)

### 1. Overview & Objectives

To establish numerical tolerances and build trust in our BEM workflow, we validate the open-source pipeline against an analytical solution. We compare two related problems that should agree closely on the rigid-sphere boundary and, by reciprocity, at far-field points ($r = 10 \mathrm{m}$):
- **Analytical scattering** of a plane wave (Morse & Ingard solution).
- **Reciprocal point source** placed a few millimeters outside the skin (Mesh2HRTF / NumCalc), acting as a stand-in for a surface microphone.

Evaluations span $100 \mathrm{Hz}$ to $8 \mathrm{kHz}$ with pressure magnitude $\vert{}p\vert{}$ reported across meridional angles ($0^\circ$ to $180^\circ$).

We compare two related but distinct problems that should agree closely
on the rigid-sphere boundary and, by reciprocity, at far-field points
at $r = 10 \mathrm{m}$:

- analytical scattering of a plane wave (Morse);
- a point source placed a few millimetres outside the skin (Mesh2HRTF / NumCalc),
  used as a reciprocal stand-in for a surface microphone.

$|p|$ is reported on the unit sphere at $0^\circ, 30^\circ, 60^\circ, 90^\circ, 120^\circ, 150^\circ, 180^\circ$.
Overall the match is excellent from $100 \mathrm{Hz}$ to $8 \mathrm{kHz}$

---

### 2. BEM Mesh & Solver Configuration

The rigid sphere and its icosahedral (Ico) mesh were generated in Blender and exported via `mesh2input` to create the NumCalc input files (`NC.inp`).

- **Mesh Resolution:** 4 subdivisions yielding **5120 triangular elements** and **2562 nodes**. 
- **Mean Edge Length:** $h \approx 7.53 \mathrm{mm}$ ($\approx 7.5 \mathrm{mm}$).
- **Sound Speed:** $c = 346.18 \mathrm{m/s}$.
- **Frequency Limit ($\lambda/6$ rule):** 
  $$f_{\lambda/6} = \frac{c}{6h} \approx 7.7 \mathrm{kHz}$$



####  BEM mesh

At $8 \mathrm{kHz}$ the mesh is slightly coarser than $\lambda/6$ ($\approx\lambda/5.75$). Burton–Miller collocation BEM often needs **more than
six elements per wavelength** at high $ka$, so part of the residual mismatch above $ka \approx 10$ ($\approx 5.5 \mathrm{kHz}$) — in particular the
$0.2 \mathrm{dB}$ drop at $0^\circ$ and $30^\circ$ toward $6 - 8 \mathrm{kHz}$ — is consistent with discretisation / quadrature rather than a geometry error. A five-subdivision Ico mesh ($20,480$ faces, $h \approx 3.8 \mathrm{mm}$) would put $\lambda/6$ well above $8 \mathrm{kHz}$ if a tighter high-frequency check is required.

#### Solver Engine (NumCalc)

NumCalc solves the Helmholtz equation with a **Burton–Miller collocation BEM**.
Optionally the **multilevel fast multipole method (ML-FMM)** replaces
element-to-element coupling by cluster-to-cluster coupling.
We used ML-FMM (cluster diameter 0.05 m). Changing it to 0.025 m did not
change the look-direction TFs on this mesh.

NumCalc solves the Helmholtz equation using a **Burton–Miller collocation BEM**, optionally accelerated by the **Multilevel Fast Multipole Method (ML-FMM)** for cluster-to-cluster coupling. 
- *Working configuration:* ML-FMM with a cluster diameter of $0.05 \mathrm{m}$ (changing this to $0.025 \mathrm{m}$ showed no noticeable change on the look-direction transfer function).

### 3. Point-Source Standoff Tuning

The Wiki guideline suggests a source standoff $\geq 0.3 \mathrm{mm}$ outside the skin, while Kreuzer recommends approximately one mean edge length. We scanned **$5 \mathrm{mm}$, $2 \mathrm{mm}$, and $1 \mathrm{mm}$** along the $+x$ axis:

<div align="center">

| Standoff | $x$-position | High-Frequency Behavior | Low-Frequency Behavior |
| :---: | :---: | :--- | :--- |
| **$5\,\mathrm{mm}$** | $0.105 \mathrm{m}$ | Drop above $5 \mathrm{kHz}$ ($0^\circ$ and $30^\circ$) | Good |
| **$2\,\mathrm{mm}$** | $0.102 \mathrm{m}$ | **Best**, near $6 \mathrm{dB}$ baffle step | Good |
| **$1\,\mathrm{mm}$** | $0.101 \mathrm{m}$ | Crushed above $3 \mathrm{kHz}$ ($\approx 5.5 \mathrm{dB}$ at $7 - 8 \mathrm{kHz}$) | Best LF collapse to $0 \mathrm{dB}$ |

</div>

> **Working Choice:** **$2 \mathrm{mm}$**. This exact offset is carried over later for the VR headset microphone positions.

---

### 4. Results and residual discrepancies

We compare two fields that reciprocity says should agree closely:

- the analytical rigid-sphere scattering of a plane wave (Morse []);
- a Mesh2HRTF / NumCalc BEM run with a point source $2 \mathrm{mm}$ outside the skin, pressure sampled at $r = 10 \mathrm{m}$ from $0^\circ$ to $180^\circ$ in a meridional plane.

The two problems are not identical, but the far-field patterns should match. They do, to a fraction of a decibel over most of the $100 \mathrm{Hz}-8\mathrm{kHz}$ band.

|                              ---                                               |  -----   |
| <p align="center"> <i> Analytical Model - Sound pressure on the sphere <br> Plane  z=0  - Various angles </i> </p>   |    <p align="center"> <i> mshr2HSRTF BEM Model - Sound pressure at 10 m  <br> Plane  z=0  - Various angles </i>        </p>              |

At $ka \approx 0.1$ the Mesh2HRTF far-field samples at $r = 10 \mathrm{m}$ are:

<div align="center">

| Angle | $\|p\|$ | Level re $0^\circ$ |
|---|---|---|
| $0^\circ$ | $1.0212\times 10^{-1}$ | $0.00 \mathrm{dB}$ |
| $30^\circ$ | $1.0161\times 10^{-1}$ | $-0.04 \mathrm{dB}$ |
| $60^\circ$ | $1.0044\times 10^{-1}$ | $-0.14 \mathrm{dB}$ |
| $90^\circ$ | $9.9313\times 10^{-2}$ | $-0.24 \mathrm{dB}$ |
| $120^\circ$ | $9.8742\times 10^{-2}$ | $-0.29 \mathrm{dB}$ |
| $150^\circ$ | $9.8670\times 10^{-2}$ | $-0.30 \mathrm{dB}$ |

</div>

The magnitude spread is **$0.30 \mathrm{dB}$**. The analytical plane-wave solution (and the reference BEM) is essentially isotropic at this $ka$. The bias is therefore numerical: Burton–Miller collocation and FMM / quadrature at low frequency, not the $2 \mathrm{mm}$ standoff and not the $10 \mathrm{m}$ station.

**Low frequency** ($50–100 \mathrm{Hz}$, $ka \approx 0.1 – 0.2$).  
The analytical field is essentially isotropic ($\sim 0 \mathrm{dB}$ spread across angles).
Mesh2HRTF shows a slightly larger magnitude variance, about $0.3–0.4 \mathrm{dB}$.

**High frequency** (around \(ka = 10\)).  
On the illuminated side ($0^\circ$ and $30^\circ$) the computed amplitude sags by about $0.2 \mathrm{dB}$.
The same droop appears in other Mesh2HRTF validations. Likely causes are the Burton–Miller discretisation, FMM clustering, and/or the quadrature — not the geometry itself.

**Parameters that do *not* move the look-direction TF.**  
FMM cluster diameter $0.05 \mathrm{m}$ vs $0.025 \mathrm{m}$ has no significant effect
on this Ico-5 mesh.

**Parameter that *does* matter.**  
Point-source standoff from the skin. After a $5 / 2 / 1\,\mathrm{mm}$ scan on $+x$, **$2 \mathrm{mm}$** is the working choice (clean high-frequency baffle step, acceptable low-frequency collapse). The same offset is used later for headset microphone positions.


- **Mesh Topology (Ico vs. UV):** Elongated polar triangles on UV meshes distort low frequencies ($100 \mathrm{Hz}$) and pole calculations; Ico triangulation avoids this entirely.
- **Piston vs. Point Sources:** A piston radiator requires area factor $S$, whereas a point source uses $P_0 = 1$ (i.e., $\frac{e^{ikR}}{4\pi R}$). At $1 \mathrm{m}$, $20\log_{10}(4\pi) \approx +22 \mathrm{dB}$ is required to reach $1 \mathrm{Pa}$.
- **High-Frequency Discretization:** At $8 \mathrm{kHz}$, the mesh is slightly coarser than $\lambda/6$ ($\approx\lambda/5.75$). Burton–Miller collocation requires adequate elements per wavelength at high $ka$, meaning the minor $\sim 0.2 \mathrm{dB}$ drop at $0^\circ$ and $30^\circ$ toward $6\text{–}8 \mathrm{kHz}$ stems from numerical quadrature rather than geometry error. (A 5-subdivision mesh with $20\,480$ faces would push $\lambda/6$ past $8 \mathrm{kHz}$).

---

### 5. Practical Summary & Takeaways

Treat Mesh2HRTF as a solid open BEM tool for research and array design — MVDR / LCMV, binaural beamforming, and SSL — in the **$100 – 8000 \mathrm{Hz}$**
band that matters for AR/VR devices. Use a $\sim 2 \mathrm{mm}$ reciprocal point source for surface microphones, keep an eye on the low-frequency angular
spread and the mild high-frequency look-direction loss, and add a targeted check when a new mesh or frequency grid is introduced.

More mature commercial BEM codes pass the $ka \approx 0.1$ test to a few hundredths of a dB. Mesh2HRTF does not: the $0.3 \mathrm{dB}$ front-to-back tilt is a low-frequency discretisation / quadrature error.

That matters for **low-frequency array design**. In a superdirective beamformer (MVDR, LCMV) a few tenths of a dB of false magnitude — and the associated phase — change the white-noise gain and the realised directivity. Treat Mesh2HRTF TFs below a few hundred hertz with extra regularisation, or cross-check that band with another solver, before freezing weights.

##  APPENDIX:  Robust Beamforming: MVDR, WNG Constraint & LCMV

### 1. Problem Formulation – Standard MVDR

We seek the optimal beamformer weights $\mathbf{w}(f)$ that minimize the output noise power while enforcing a distortionless response in the look direction $\mathbf{d}(f)$:

$$
\min_{\mathbf{w}} \quad \mathbf{w}^H \mathbf{R}_{vv}(f) \mathbf{w}
\quad \text{subject to} \quad \mathbf{w}^H \mathbf{d}(f) = 1
$$

The closed-form solution is the classic MVDR beamformer:

$$
\mathbf{w}_{\text{MVDR}}(f) = \frac{\mathbf{R}_{vv}(f)^{-1} \mathbf{d}(f)}{\mathbf{d}^H(f) \mathbf{R}_{vv}(f)^{-1} \mathbf{d}(f)}
$$

### 2. White Noise Gain (WNG) Constraint

In practice, the pure MVDR solution is often overly sensitive to sensor noise, calibration errors and steering vector mismatches.  
To improve robustness we impose a **White Noise Gain** constraint:

$$
\text{WNG}(f) = \frac{|\mathbf{w}^H \mathbf{d}|^2}{\mathbf{w}^H \mathbf{w}} \geq \text{WNG}_{\min}
$$

This is equivalent to limiting the $\ell_2$-norm of the weight vector.

#### Practical realisation – Diagonal Loading

A simple and effective way to enforce the WNG constraint is **diagonal loading** (Tikhonov regularisation):

$$
\mathbf{w}(f,\alpha) = \frac{ \bigl(\mathbf{R}_{vv}(f) + \alpha \mathbf{I}\bigr)^{-1} \mathbf{d}(f) }
{ \mathbf{d}^H(f) \bigl(\mathbf{R}_{vv}(f) + \alpha \mathbf{I}\bigr)^{-1} \mathbf{d}(f) }
$$

- $\alpha = 0$ → pure MVDR (highest directivity, lowest robustness)
- $\alpha \to \infty$ → approaches Delay-and-Sum (highest robustness, lower directivity)

By sweeping the loading factor $\alpha$ (or $\sigma^2$) we obtain the classic trade-off between Directivity Index (DI) and White Noise Gain (WNG).

### 3. Linearly Constrained Minimum Variance (LCMV)

When more than one spatial constraint is required we generalise MVDR to the **LCMV** beamformer.

We now enforce a set of linear constraints:

$$
\mathbf{C}^H \mathbf{w} = \mathbf{g}
$$

where
- $\mathbf{C} = [\mathbf{d}_0,\; \mathbf{d}_{180},\; \dots]$ contains the steering vectors of the constrained directions,
- $\mathbf{g}$ is the desired response vector (e.g. $[1, 0]^T$ for look-direction distortionless + null at 180°).

The closed-form LCMV solution is:

$$
\mathbf{w}_{\text{LCMV}} = \mathbf{R}_{vv}^{-1}\mathbf{C}\bigl(\mathbf{C}^H\mathbf{R}_{vv}^{-1}\mathbf{C}\bigr)^{-1}\mathbf{g}
$$

With diagonal loading the same regularisation principle applies:

$$
\mathbf{w}_{\text{LCMV}}(\alpha) = (\mathbf{R}_{vv}+\alpha\mathbf{I})^{-1}\mathbf{C}
\Bigl(\mathbf{C}^H(\mathbf{R}_{vv}+\alpha\mathbf{I})^{-1}\mathbf{C}\Bigr)^{-1}\mathbf{g}
$$

Typical use-cases on the Kemar + VR Headset array:
- **Look beamformer**: $\mathbf{g}=[1,0]^T$ (distortionless at 0°, null at 180°)
- **Noise-channel beamformer**: $\mathbf{g}=[0,1]^T$ (null at 0°, distortionless at 180°)

### 4. Directivity Index (DI) on the Sphere

The Directivity Index quantifies how much the array concentrates energy in the look direction relative to an isotropic response.

**Continuous definition** (exact theoretical expression):

$$
\text{DI}(f) = 10\log_{10}\left(\frac{4\pi\,|\mathbf{w}^H\mathbf{d}_0|^2}{\displaystyle\int_{S^2}|\mathbf{w}^H\mathbf{d}(\Omega)|^2\,d\Omega}\right)
$$

where the integral is performed over the unit sphere $S^2$ and $d\Omega=\sin\theta\,d\theta\,d\phi$.

**Discrete approximation** used with the 2522-point COMSOL sphere:

$$
\text{DI}(f) \approx 10\log_{10}\left(\frac{N}{\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{N}|\mathbf{w}^H\mathbf{d}_i|^2}\right)
$$

or, more accurately with the surface element:

$$
\text{DI}(f) \approx 10\log_{10}\left(\frac{4\pi}{\Delta\Omega\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{N}|\mathbf{w}^H\mathbf{d}_i|^2\sin\theta_i}\right)
$$

where $N=2522$ and $\Delta\Omega$ is the solid-angle element corresponding to the spherical grid.  
When the look-direction constraint $\mathbf{w}^H\mathbf{d}_0=1$ is enforced, the numerator simplifies to $4\pi$ (continuous) or $N$ (discrete uniform weighting).



### 5. The Pareto Front

When optimising two conflicting objectives (Directivity Index versus White Noise Gain) the set of optimal trade-off solutions forms the **Pareto front**.

- Any point on the front is optimal: one metric cannot be improved without degrading the other.
- Points above/left of the front are impossible.
- Points below/right of the front are sub-optimal.

In our implementation the Pareto front is traced simply by sweeping the diagonal-loading parameter $\alpha$ (or $\sigma^2$) and recording the resulting (DI, WNG) pairs.
